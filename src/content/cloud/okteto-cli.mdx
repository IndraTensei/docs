[Dev Environments](reference/development-environments.mdx) allow you to develop your deployed application locally. You continue coding in your favorite IDE and see the changes live on the deployed version of your application as soon as you hit save.
Okteto CLI is an [open source](https://github.com/okteto/okteto) client-side only tool that allows you to launch Dev Environments in any Kubernetes cluster: your own, [Okteto Cloud](index.md), or [Okteto Self-Hosted](self-hosted.mdx).

## okteto up

The `okteto up` command is one of Okteto CLI's main features and key to the Okteto development experience. This command uses the [Okteto Manifest](/reference/manifest) you define to build, deploy, and synchronize your local files with the remote development container.

This command has two modes: `sync` (default mode) and `hybrid` which are detailed below.

|                   | `sync` (default) | `hybrid` |
| :---------------- | :--------------- | :------- |
| Source code       | Source code is edited locally and synchronizes bidirectionally (via Syncthing) with a copy of the source code in the remote development container. | Source code is edited locally for a chosen set of microservices. |
| App location      | The application exists entirely within the remote development container. | Your application is split between your local environment and the remote development container based on your configuration. |
| `command` context | CLI commands run in the remote development container. | CLI commands run on your local machine, so traffic need to be rerouted to/from the cluster, e.g. using the reverse option |

Below is a reference to help you configure your [`dev` section](/reference/manifest/#dev-object-optional) based on the mode you select. **Standard** configuration options work in both modes and **Sync** options work *only* when `sync` is selected.

For example, if you select `hybrid` mode, you can only use the configuration options in your manifest `dev` section listed under **Standard**. Any configuration options in the **Sync** list will *not work*.

### When to use `hybrid` development mode

A typical use case for using `hybrid` development mode is when the filesync or rebuild is significantly slower on the remote dev container, such as when using Webpack where this becomes very noticeable compared to your local environment. 

Another use case is when you’re using a framework that is IDE-heavy. For example, on Java/Spring, IDEs tend to be pre-configured to run tests, start services, and connect debuggers. You lose some of that ‘click and you are done’ when you are using the traditional `okteto up` and the default `sync` mode.

:::info
Keep in mind that using `hybrid` mode means breaking replicability between Operating Systems (local and remote) and may add latency when accessing other services in the cluster.
:::

### How to use `hybrid` development mode

In order to use `hybrid` mode you only need to configure the necessary ports to expose the service running on your local machine to the remote development container. This enables other components running on the cluster to communicate with your local service(s) as if your local service(s) was running in the cluster as well.

To do this, you can use the [reverse](/reference/manifest/#reverse-string-optional) field to expose the desired port of your local machine to the desired port on the remote development container.

```yaml
dev:
  frontend:
    mode: hybrid
    reverse:
    - 3000:8080
    workdir: ./frontend
    command: ["npx webpack watch --mode development"]

```

In the example above we have indicated that we are developing the `frontend` service locally using the `mode: hybrid` field.  The service running locally will execute the `command` instructions in the directory indicated in `workdir`. Additionally, the application will expose port `8080` on the local machine and communicate bidirectionally with port `3000` on the development container. This makes it possible for other components running on the cluster to access the local service as if it were running remotely.

## Deployment Manifests

You need one of the following deployment manifests for your application so that Okteto CLI knows how to launch a Dev Environment for it. Okteto CLI will analyze your existing manifests (Helm, Kubernetes, etc.) and help you write an [Okteto Manifest](#okteto-manifest) for your application. It will then use this Okteto Manifest instead of your existing deployment manifests to spin up Dev Environments.

If you're using a Docker Compose file, then Okteto CLI can directly launch a Dev Environment for your application without generating an Okteto Manifest. However, you can still choose to create the Okteto Manifest if you want more configuration over your environment.

Okteto CLI will look for deployment manifests for your application in the following order:

1. [Okteto Manifest](reference/manifest.mdx) file: if there is an `okteto.yaml` or `.okteto/okteto.yaml` file in your folder, Okteto will use this file to deploy your development environment.
1. [Docker Compose](reference/docker-compose.mdx) file: if there is an `okteto-compose.yaml` or `docker-compose.yaml` file, Okteto will use this file to deploy your development environment.
1. [Helm Chart](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/): if there is a `chart`, `charts`, `helm/chart`, or `helm/charts` directory with a `Chart.yaml` file in it, Okteto will detect the chart and run `helm upgrade --install` on it to deploy your development environment.
1. [Kubernetes manifests](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/manage-deployment/) folder: if there is a `manifests`, `kubernetes`, or `k8s` folder, Okteto will detect it and run `kubectl apply` to deploy your development environment.
1. [Kubernetes manifests](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/manage-deployment/) file: if there is a `manifests.yaml`, `kubernetes.yaml`, or `k8s.yaml` file, Okteto will detect it and run `kubectl apply` to deploy your development environment

You can also explicitly define the location of the Okteto Manifest using the `-f` flag on any Okteto CLI command.


## Okteto manifest

The Okteto manifest allows you to provide configuration for building, deploying, and developing your application in a Development Environment. This file is optional if you already have a Docker Compose file for your application. Learn more about the Okteto manifest [here](reference/manifest.mdx).

### Sample Okteto Manifest

```yaml
icon: https://apps.okteto.com/movies/icon.png
build:
  api:
    context: .
deploy:
  - helm upgrade --install app chart --set image=${OKTETO_BUILD_API_IMAGE}
dev:
  api:
    command: ["bash"]
    forward:
      - 8080:8080
      - 9229:9229
    sync:
      - .:/usr/src/app
```

This example shows how to [build](reference/manifest.mdx/#build-object-optional) the container image of the **api** microservice, how to [deploy](reference/manifest.mdx/#deploy-object-optional) the application using its helm chart,
and how to [develop](reference/manifest.mdx/#dev-object-optional) on the **api** microservice by synchronizing the local filesystem on the container path `/usr/src/app`.
If you want to learn more about what all you can configure in this manifest, head over to the [Okteto Manifest Reference](reference/manifest.mdx).

### Built-in Environment Variables

#### Default Environment Variables

The following environment variables are automatically populated to be referred in your Okteto Manifest or deploy/destroy commands:
- `OKTETO_DOMAIN`: the domain where Okteto exposes your application endpoints.
- `OKTETO_NAMESPACE`: the namespace where your application is going to be installed.
- `OKTETO_USERNAME`: your username in Okteto.
- `OKTETO_REGISTRY_URL`: the url of the [Okteto Registry](cloud/registry.mdx).
- `OKTETO_GIT_BRANCH`: the name of the Git branch currently being deployed.
- `OKTETO_GIT_COMMIT`: the SHA1 hash of the last commit of the branch.

#### Built-in Environment Variables for Images stored in the Okteto Registry

You can refer to the images defined in the [build](reference/manifest.mdx/#build-object-optional) section of the Okteto Manifest using the following environment variables:
- `OKTETO_BUILD_<image>_IMAGE`: the full image reference
- `OKTETO_BUILD_<image>_REGISTRY`: the registry URL where the image was pushed
- `OKTETO_BUILD_<image>_REPOSITORY`: the name of the image that was pushed
- `OKTETO_BUILD_<image>_SHA`: The latest tag and the SHA of the image

For example, for the following `build` section:

```yaml
build:
  hello-world:
    context: .
```

Okteto will build a random image tag like `registry.cloud.okteto.net/cindy/hello-world:f56119a37b`, and you would have the following environment variables available:

- `OKTETO_BUILD_HELLO_WORLD_IMAGE`: registry.cloud.okteto.net/cindy/hello-world@sha256:xxx
- `OKTETO_BUILD_HELLO_WORLD_REGISTRY`: registry.cloud.okteto.net
- `OKTETO_BUILD_HELLO_WORLD_REPOSITORY`: cindy/hello-world
- `OKTETO_BUILD_HELLO_WORLD_SHA`: f56119a37b@sha256:xxx

> if an `<image>` name includes the symbol `-`, in the corresponding `OKTETO_BUILD_<image>` environment variables, the symbol `-` will be replaced by `_`.  For example, if `<image>` is `name-with-hyphen`, the environment variable names will start with `$OKTETO_BUILD_NAME_WITH_HYPHEN_`.

#### Built-in Environment Variables for Dependencies

You can refer to the variables defined by your [dependencies](reference/manifest.mdx/#dependencies-object-optional) using the following environment variables:
- `OKTETO_DEPENDENCY_<dependency>_VARIABLE_<variable>`: the value of a variable of a dependency.

For example, if you have the following dependency in your Okteto Manifest:

```yaml
dependencies:
  database:
    repository: https://github.com/okteto/my-database
    variables:
      USERNAME: okteto
    wait: true
```

and the repo https://github.com/okteto/my-database has the following Okteto Manifest:

```yaml
deploy:
  - echo "PASSWORD=1234" >> $OKTETO_ENV
```

You can refer to the variables of https://github.com/okteto/my-database in the `deploy` section of your Okteto Manifest like this:

```yaml
dependencies:
  database:
    repository: https://github.com/okteto/my-database
    variables:
      USERNAME: okteto
    wait: true
deploy:
  - echo ${OKTETO_DEPENDENCY_DATABASE_VARIABLE_USERNAME}
  - echo ${OKTETO_DEPENDENCY_DATABASE_VARIABLE_PASSWORD}
```

Note that `USERNAME` has an static value, and `PASSWORD` is dynamically generated.

### Built-in Tools When Deploying To Okteto

When deploying your development environment, Okteto executes the sequence of `deploy` commands.
The commands run in a Debian Linux container with the following tools preinstalled:

- `bash`
- `cue`
- `curl`
- `envsubst`
- `git`
- `helm`
- `kubectl`
- `kustomize`
- `make`
- `okteto`
- `openssh`
- `wait-for-it`

You can also configure your own [container image](reference/manifest.mdx/#deploy-remotely) to use your own tools in your `deploy` commands.
For example, if you need to invoke terraform commands, you could do:

```yaml
deploy:
  image: hashicorp/terraform:1.4
  commands:
    - terraform apply -auto-approve
```
