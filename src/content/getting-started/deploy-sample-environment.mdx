Okteto automates the process of deploying your development environment on Kubernetes. In Okteto, a development environment consists of the following components: 

1. An Okteto manifest
1. A Kubernetes namespace
1. Your application's Kubernetes resources (e.g. services, deployments, pods, volumes, etc.)
1. Public HTTPs endpoints
1. Your application's external dependencies (e.g. secrets, cloud databases, documentation, etc.)

When you deploy a development environment, Okteto will automate the creation of all the resources required for your application to run.

## The Movies App

In order to show you how Okteto deploys a development environment, we'll be using "The Movies App", one of our reference applications. 

The Movies App is a microservice-based application. It includes:
1. **Frontend service:** A React-based service that uses webpack as bundler
1. **Backend service:**  A Node.js-based service that serves the available movies from a MongoDB database
1. **Backend service:** A Java based rent service to receive rent requests and send them to Kafka
1. **Backend service:** A Golang based api to retrieve the current movies rentals from the PostgresSQL database
1. **Worker service:** A Golang based worker to process rent request from Kafka and update the PostgreSQL database
1. A MongoDB database
1. A Kafka queue
1. A PostgresQL database
1. A Helm chart

</p>

The source code for the application [is available on GitHub](https://github.com/okteto/movies).

## Deploy your development environment

Go to your Okteto instance, and click on the **Launch Dev Environment** button on the top left. A dialog will open asking for the URL of a Git Repository to deploy. Copy/paste the URL of the Movies App repository (https://github.com/okteto/movies), and click **Launch**.

When you launch a development environment, Okteto will perform the following actions:
1. Clone the git repository.
1. Look for an okteto manifest, which defines how the development environment will be created. 
1. Build your container images using an Okteto-managed build service.
1. Push the container images to an internal Okteto-managed container registry.
1. Create all the required Kubernetes resources.
1. Create publicly available endpoints so you can access your application.
1. Display the components, their state, and their logs in the Okteto UI.

## Use your Development Environment

When your environment is ready, you can access it using the available endpoints in the Okteto UI. This is a fully functional application that is running on your Kubernetes cluster, all managed by Okteto.

When you are done, you can destroy your development environment by clicking the destroy button in the Okteto UI. Okteto will automatically delete all the resources created during deployment.

Common use cases for Development Environments are:
1. Integrate with the Okteto CLI to synchronize your code and debug remotely.
1. Share live environments with the rest of your team.
1. Standarize the development workflow of your entire team.
1. Run end to end tests.
1. Show customers work in progress.  


## Next Steps
In this section we deployed a sample development environment. Next we're going to show you how to use the Okteto CLI to synchronize code changes between your local machine and your remote development environment in Okteto.
