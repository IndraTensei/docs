The Okteto CLI allows you to interact with your Okteto-managed remote development environment from your terminal. With the Okteto CLI you can:
1. Launch a development environment
1. Synchronize your code between your local machine and your development environment
1. Execute remote commands
1. See your logs
1. And more...


In this section, we'll show you how you can use the Okteto CLI to work with the environment that you deployed on the previous section. 


## Installing Okteto CLI

Install the Okteto CLI following these steps:

### MacOS / Linux

```console
$ curl https://get.okteto.com -sSfL | sh
```

If you need a specific version you can set the OKTETO_VERSION environment variable:

```console
$ curl https://get.okteto.com -sSfL | OKTETO_VERSION=2.3.3 sh
```

You can also install it via [brew](https://brew.sh/) by running:

```console
$ brew install okteto
```

### Windows

Download https://downloads.okteto.com/cli/stable/okteto.exe and add it to your `$PATH`.

You can also install it via [scoop](https://scoop.sh/) by running:

```console
$ scoop install okteto
```

> For updating okteto with scoop, you might need to `scoop unhold okteto & scoop update okteto` or `scoop uninstall okteto & scoop install okteto`

### GitHub

Alternatively, you can directly download the binary [from GitHub](https://github.com/okteto/okteto/releases) or build it directly from the source code.

## Connect the CLI to your Okteto instance

After installing the Okteto CLI, you need to run the command below to log in to your Okteto instance:

```console
$ okteto context use https://okteto.localtest.me --skip-tls-verify
```

You can confirm that your CLI is configured by running the command below:

```console
$ okteto context list
```
```console
Name                          Namespace       Builder                                 Registry
https://okteto.localtest.me *  cindylopez      tcp://buildkit.okteto.localtest.me:1234  registry.okteto.localtest.me
```

## Developing with the Okteto CLI

Next, a prompt will ask for the microservice you want to develop.

```console
    Select the development container you want to activate:
    Use the arrow keys to navigate: ↓ ↑ → ←
  ▸ api
    frontend
```

Let's go with `api` because we know there's a bug there we need to fix 🙂

```console
 ✓  Development container 'api' selected
 ✓  Persistent volume successfully attached
 ✓  Images successfully pulled
 ✓  Files synchronized
    Context:   okteto.example.com
    Namespace: cindylopezlopez
    Name:      api
    Forward:   9229 -> 9229

yarn run v1.22.19
$ nodemon server.js
[nodemon] 2.0.4
[nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
[nodemon] watching path(s): *.*
[nodemon] watching extensions: js,mjs,json
[nodemon] starting `node server.js`
Server running on port 8080.
```

Now, you should be able to view your application when you visit these endpoints. Behind the scenes, the Development Environment in Okteto will synchronize your changes everytime you save them locally.

## Development Time!

Visiting the frontend endpoint for the Movies app, something doesn't look right here, does it?

    alt="UI showing the movies app"
    width="850"
  />
</p>

The list of movies is the same as Cindy's list. Let's fix that.

Open your favorite IDE on your local machine and edit line 43 in `/api/server.js` to:

```javascript
  db.collection('watching').find().toArray( (err, results) =>{
```

Now save your changes and refresh the browser. Okteto CLI will automatically synchronize your changes to your development environment. Take a look at the development environment shell and notice how the changes are detected by [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) and automatically hot reloaded.

```console
[nodemon] restarting due to changes...
[nodemon] starting `node server.js`
Server running on port 8080.
```

Okteto's Development Environment immediately shows the changes you made on the deployed version of your application. You don't need to wait for a CI pipeline to complete before you can validate the changes you've made. This saves a ton of time.

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You successfully developed your first application with Okteto

From here, we recommend:
- Launching a Development Environment for your own application using this guide
- Reading about Okteto's [Preview Environments](cloud/preview-environments/overview.mdx)
