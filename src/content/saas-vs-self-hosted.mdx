Okteto consists of two products: our [CLI](/cloud/okteto-cli) and the [Okteto Platform](#). You can use the Okteto CLI without using the Okteto platform, but there are important limitations with that use case. 

The Okteto Platform is the other half of our product experience that provides the fully managed infrastructure for your development environments. It's what interprets the [Okteto Manifest](/reference/manifest) to spin up a development environment and automates your workflows. 

Some examples of what the Okteto paltform manages are: sleeping/waking resources, incorporating external resources into your development environment, and automatically scaling your development environment as your application's needs grow.

Within the context of the Okteto Platform we offer this experience in two ways: a fully-managed SaaS experience and a DIY self-hosted installation using a Helm chart.

# Important things to know

- Fully managed by Okteto
- Limitations in configurations for complex environments
- Easy and fast to get started

Self-Hosted

- More flexibility in the installation and configuration of the platform/experience
- Fully managed by you as the customer
- More complex to setup
