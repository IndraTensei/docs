Okteto consists of two products: our [CLI](/cloud/okteto-cli) and the Okteto Platform. You can use the Okteto CLI without using the Okteto Platform, but there are important limitations with that use case. 

The Okteto Platform is the other half of our product experience that provides the fully managed infrastructure for your development environments. It's what interprets the [Okteto Manifest](/reference/manifest) to spin up a development environment and automates your workflows. One of the biggest advantages of the Okteto Platform is that we scale the underlying cluster infrastructure so you never have to worry about your development environments having insufficient resources to run even your most complex applications.

Some examples of what the Okteto Platform manages are: [configuring secrets](/cloud/secrets/), adding external resources into your development environment, and push container images to the [Okteto Registry](/cloud/registry/). For a more comprehensive list of features, check out our [docs](/self-hosted/).

Within the context of the Okteto Platform we offer this experience in two ways: a fully-managed SaaS experience and a self-hosted installation using a Helm chart.
